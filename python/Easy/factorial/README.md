# Find the Factorial of a Number

## Problem Description

Write a Python program to find the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`.  
Implement **two versions**:

-   Using recursion
-   Using a loop (iteration)

---

## Input

A single non-negative integer `n` (`0 ≤ n ≤ 20`)

---

## Output

The factorial of `n`, denoted as `n!`, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

## Example

**Input:**  
5  
**Output:**  
120 # 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

**Input:**  
0  
**Output:**  
1 # 0! is defined as
