# Count Vowels

## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) present in the string.  
The function should be **case-insensitive**.

---

## Example

```python
count_vowels("Hello World")        # → 3
count_vowels("Python is Fun")      # → 4
count_vowels("AEIOUaeiou")         # → 10
```

## Constraints

-   Input will be a non-empty string.
-   The function should not modify the original string.
-   You should ignore spaces, numbers, and special characters.
