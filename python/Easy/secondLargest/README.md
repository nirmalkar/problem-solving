# Find the Second Largest Element in a List

## Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers. Write a function that returns the second largest **distinct** element in the list.  
If there is no such element (i.e., all elements are the same or the list has fewer than two distinct values), return `None`.

## Examples

```python
# Input: [10, 20, 4, 45, 99]
# Output: 45

# Input: [5, 5, 5]
# Output: None

# Input: [3, 2]
# Output: 2
```

## Constraints

-   The list can contain negative numbers.
-   The list may have duplicate elements.
-   The list can have up to 10^5 elements.
